# Two simple examples of adding two numbers
# They are designed to be implemented within a .py file
# They would need the addition of raw input to run from the 
# 	command line
# Also note that the float version does not round, just
# 	dropping all numbers after a decimal. This is not always
# 	practical, but good for teaching


# python function to add two numbers
def addTwoNumbers(firstnumber, secondnumber):
    sum = float(firstnumber) + float(secondnumber)
    return sum
    
# python function to add two Integers
def addTwoIntegers(firstnumber, secondnumber):
    sum = int(firstnumber) + int(secondnumber)
    return sum
