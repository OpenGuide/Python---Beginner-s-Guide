#Floyd's triangle
#	Floyd's triangle is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers
#	used in computer science education. It is defined by filling the rows of 
#	the triangle with consecutive numbers, starting with a 1 in the top left corner

n = input() 			# Number of rows of Floyd's triangle

number = 1  			# Beginning number for the triangle

# Function range(start,end) creates a list like [start...end-1]
# Eg. range(1,3) creates list [1,2]
# Function range(end) creates a list like [0..end-1]
# Eg. range(3) creates list [0,1,2]

for i in range(1,n+1): 		# Total number of rows to be printed 
	for j in range(1,i+1):	# Total number of columns in each row
		print number,   # Add , after print statement to prevent line break
		number +=1	# Increment the number
	print			# Add a line break
